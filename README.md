## Usage
 
## Technology Used
* 

* Handlebars.js is a logicless templating language that keeps the View and the code separate and compiles templates into JavaScript functions. 

* Express-Session Package is an Express.js middleware that uses sessions, a mechanism that helps applications to determine whether multiple requests came from the same client. Developers may assign every user a unique session so that their application can store the user state, and thus authenticate users.

* Connect-Session-Sequelize Package provides applications with a scalable store for sessions. The express-session package’s default server-side session storage, MemoryStore, is purposely not designed for a production environment, will leak memory under most conditions, doesn’t scale past a single process, and is only meant for debugging and developing. The connect-session-sequelize package resolves these issues and is compatible with the Sequelize ORM.
